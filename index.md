# Smart Mirror
My goal is to use a raspberry pi to program a screen in order to make a smart mirror. 
It will contain information such at the time, date, upcoming calendar events and the weather in the area. Additionally, LED lights around the boarder of the miror will change color from warm to cool based on the temprature.

# Final Milestone

My third and final milestone was assembling my mirror. To do so I used a hot glue gun to attatch the monitor to the glass and then I proceeded to tape my LED lights along the edge. What was supposed to be my easiest and quickest milestone turned into a disaster when my raspberry pi stopped working. Luckily i was able to order a new one just in time and I spent hours restoring my project to its original state. I am proud of everything I accomplished.

# Second Milestone

My second milstone was finishing adding all of my unique modules. To add all the information I wanted to my monitor, I used the react app to write diffrent sections of code in Javascript making each module function. My mirror displays the date, time, weather, and it features changing LED lights according to the numerical temprature (warm colors for warm weather and cooler colors for cold weather). This milestone took the longest time by far because I basically made the modules from scratch and I had little to no expiriance with coding something like this.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my monitor. The heatsinks the sd card with the linux operating system were added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Then I had to activate SSH which allows me to remotly acess the terminal and VNC which allows me to see and control my monitor from my computer. I did run into an issue where I had no working keyboard and just a mouse but I was able to overcome that with alot of copying and pasting. I also have a miror design.
